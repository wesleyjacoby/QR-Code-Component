## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS Custom Properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to center the card in the viewport using the "vh" unit that I had not learnt about before. I also learnt how to resize the image (QR Code) using the max-width property.

```css
.card-container img {
    max-width: 100%;
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 40px;
}
```

### Continued development

I still seem to struggle with resizing and positioning images. This is something I'd like to continue working on. I also need to continue practicing using Flexbox.
